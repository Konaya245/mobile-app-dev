if (a != null && a != "" && a.length != 0){} rather than this can do if(a) to check if not empty.


fixed list using number is kiddy stuff we use generics? unlimited now.
prefill the list to make a list fixed size

set = unordered object that stores unit values. no duplicates different from array. 
e.g. matric numbers and names.
set uses curly braces whereas list uses square brackets. 

must declare variable e.g. <String> infront of the curly braces to make it a set, else it will be a map.
=> fat arrow function is a shorthand for one line functions.
arrow function simplest for one line functions when you need to return value.


A standard function in dart must consist the following elements:  
Data_Type Function_Name (parameters){    
  //Operation on the given parameter;    
  //Optional Return of the operationâ€™s result; 
}

square bracket for optional parameters.
variable assignment in function parameter makes it the default parameter.
eg. bool threshold(int i =1){}

Recap from last class:
Properties are variables. Functions will become method, its properties are variables. Method will change value of properties. 


main() is a reserved word. 
5 data type int etc is primitive. String is a reference datatype uses pointers. 
3 types of constructors, default,parameterized, named. Exampels in handout

extend keyword to inherit all properties and methods from parent class
super keyword used you can name a setter etc. without inheriting from parent. call from current class/override

in dart you can use mixin with keyword to inherit more than one eg. 
class Kulliyah extends Student with Department, Specialization{}

_ underscore infront of method/variables to make it private. 

create each class in a seperate file so it is easier to debug. eg. import student.dart

.. cascade operator can be usedso you dont have to assign a variable to instantiate class methods.
e.g void main(){   
    new Student()   
    ..setName("ali")   
    ..display(); 
    }

Programming paradigm
Imperative - have to put everything like java
Declarative  - eg. type= button, will create button html and flutter

everything is a widget in flutter
i. layout : column, row, scaffold, stack (like fotoshop layer)
ii. structures : button, toast (alert), menudrawer
rest in handout

stateful vs stateless widget - interactable vs static e.g. quantity number increase vs buttons. stateful widget lifecycle will dispose of after closing/idling
use containers to manage layout easier
event triggers setState() to change the state after
